    content:
      "Improving egg production requires attention to several key factors:\n\n1. Nutrition: Feed your chickens a balanced diet with 16-18% protein. Provide calcium supplements like oyster shells for strong eggshells.\n\n2. Light: Chickens need 14-16 hours of light daily to maintain egg production. During winter, consider adding artificial lighting in the coop.\n\n3. Water: Always provide clean, fresh water. Dehydration quickly affects egg production.\n\n4. Stress Reduction: Minimize stress by providing adequate space (at least 4 square feet per bird), proper ventilation, and protection from predators.\n\n5. Regular Collection: Collect eggs at least twice daily to encourage hens to continue laying.\n\n6. Coop Cleanliness: Keep the nesting boxes clean and filled with fresh bedding material.\n\nImplementing these practices can significantly increase your flock's egg production throughout the year.",
